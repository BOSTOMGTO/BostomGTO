This small, unmarked, speakeasy pub is a Secret, barely lighted, and requires reservations in order to enter. It was popular during Prohibition in the 1920s and 1930s. Bostom creates distinctive drinks by combining premium spirits, locally sourced fresh ingredients, and hand-made mixers. Two-hour blocks are used for reservations.
